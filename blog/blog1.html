    <h1>Understanding Singapore's Career Conversion Programmes (CCP)</h1>
    <p>Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) are designed to help Singapore businesses and mid-career employees adapt to a changing economy. Through CCPs, companies receive substantial government funding to train mid-career hires or reskill existing staff into new, in-demand roles. This initiative supports around 30 industry sectors, from technology and finance to healthcare and logistics.</p>
    <p>One of the main benefits of a CCP is financial support: the government can subsidize up to 90% of a trainee's salary during the training period. This makes it far more affordable for companies to invest in employee development. The programmes typically involve structured courses and on-the-job training, often provided by accredited training organizations.</p>
    <p>There are several CCP pathways. In a "Place-and-Train" model, for example, a company hires an individual for a new role and trains them on the job. In an "Attach-and-Train" model, companies host potential hires for short attachments or courses before making a hiring decision. Another mode allows existing employees to be upskilled for redesigned roles within the company. Each pathway is tailored to different hiring and training scenarios.</p>
    <p>At BizGrants Consulting, we help businesses navigate these pathways and maximize the benefits of CCP funding. By understanding the specific needs of each company and its employees, we can recommend the most suitable CCP and guide you through the application process.</p>
