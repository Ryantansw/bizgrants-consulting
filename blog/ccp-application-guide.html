    <h1>Step-by-Step Guide: How to Apply for a CCP in Singapore</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Applying for a Career Conversion Programme (CCP) can seem daunting, but with a clear roadmap, Singapore companies can successfully tap into generous salary support to future-proof their workforce. Here’s a practical, step-by-step guide based on the latest requirements.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Assess Your Company’s Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is your business registered and operating in Singapore?</li>
      <li>Do you have eligible Singaporean or PR staff for reskilling, or are you planning to hire?</li>
      <li>Will the new role involve at least 50% change in job scope (for existing staff)?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. Choose the Right CCP Pathway</h2>
    <p>
      CCPs exist for many sectors (e.g., Digital, Sustainability, Finance, HR). Identify the most relevant programme and understand its specific criteria. You can browse <a href="https://conversion.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/Portal/ProgramListing.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#0F52BA;">the full list here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Prepare the Required Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Company ACRA/Bizfile and HR contact details</li>
      <li>Job description for the redesigned/new role</li>
      <li>Employee’s latest CV, NRIC, and employment contract</li>
      <li>Training plan (OJT and external, where required)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Submit the Application</h2>
    <p>
      Applications are typically submitted via the appointed programme manager. Each manager has its own process—ensure all forms are complete and all supporting documents are clear.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Respond to Queries & Provide Clarifications</h2>
    <p>
      Be prepared for follow-up questions from assessors. Common issues include unclear job redesign, insufficient documentation, or mismatch in employee background.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Receive Approval and Commence Programme</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Upon approval, salary support will be disbursed in tranches after evidence of completion is submitted.</li>
      <li>OJT must be tracked and documented.</li>
      <li>Retain all supporting evidence for audit purposes.</li>
    </ul>
