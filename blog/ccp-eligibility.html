    <h1>What is the Career Conversion Programme (CCP) and Who is Eligible?</h1>

    <h2>Understanding the CCP</h2>
    <p>
      The Career Conversion Programme (CCP) is Workforce Singapore’s flagship initiative to help companies reskill mid-career hires or existing staff for new or redesigned roles. For many Singapore employers, this scheme translates to substantial salary support, enabling business transformation while minimising risk.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is Eligible?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For Companies:</strong> Registered and operating in Singapore, including both SMEs and non-SMEs. SMEs enjoy enhanced support rates.</li>
      <li><strong>For Employees:</strong> Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, aged 21 and above, either newly hired (within the last 3 months) or existing staff whose jobs are redesigned (with at least 50% change in job content).</li>
      <li>Employees must not be company shareholders, immediate family of shareholders, or ex-employees rejoining within 6 months.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Consider CCP?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access up to <strong>90% salary support</strong> for reskilled staff (3 to 6 months, depending on pathway).</li>
      <li>Strengthen workforce capabilities and stay competitive amid rapid change.</li>
      <li>Mitigate hiring and training risks with structured support.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How Do You Get Started?</h2>
    <p>
      The CCP process involves careful documentation and a clear demonstration of job conversion. At BizGrants Consulting, our flat-fee, success-only consulting model ensures you only pay when value is delivered—50% upfront, and a full refund if your application is unsuccessful.
