    <h1>What is the Career Conversion Programme (CCP) and Who is Eligible in Singapore?</h1>
    <p>
      For Singapore employers looking to future-proof their workforce or tap into government funding, the Career Conversion Programme (CCP) is one of the most effective levers. Yet, many SMEs and HR professionals remain unsure of the basics: What is CCP? Who qualifies? How do you maximise your chances of success?
    </p>
    <h2>What is the Career Conversion Programme (CCP)?</h2>
    <p>
      CCP is a Workforce Singapore (WSG)-funded grant that supports companies to reskill new hires or existing staff for redesigned roles. The government will co-fund up to <strong>90% of salary</strong> for a defined period, enabling employers to lower their hiring risk and build new capabilities—especially in areas such as digital, sustainability, HR, tech, marketing, and business transformation.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is Eligible for CCP Funding?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Singapore-registered companies</strong> hiring Singaporeans or PRs into new or significantly redesigned roles</li>
      <li>Roles must show at least <strong>50% change in job content</strong> (for existing staff)</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-career professionals</strong> being hired or reskilled</li>
      <li>Employee must not be a shareholder or immediate family of directors</li>
      <li>Both SMEs and large enterprises may apply; SMEs often get higher funding rates</li>
      <li><strong>Structured On-the-Job Training (OJT)</strong> plan is mandatory for approval</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      <li><strong>Talent pipeline:</strong> Hire mid-careerists or upskill current staff for growth roles</li>
