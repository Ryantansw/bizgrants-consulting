    <h1>GRIT vs Mid-Career Pathways vs CCP: Which Programme Fits SME Hiring in Singapore (2026)</h1>

    <p>
      If you are an SME in Singapore, you have probably heard about government supported manpower schemes and wondered,
      “Which one actually fits our hiring plan?”
      The reality is that these programmes are designed for different outcomes:
      internships for fresh talent, short attachments for mature workers, or structured reskilling for long-term roles.
    </p>

    <div class="blog-article-note">
      <p style="margin:0;">
        <strong>Advisory note:</strong>
        The funding rates and caps below are commonly referenced figures and should be treated as a practical guide.
        Final eligibility and support levels can vary by programme partner, role design, and prevailing programme terms.

    </div>

    <h2 id="quick-take">Quick take: which programme fits what</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a practical way to think about it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="pill">GRIT</span> Useful when you want <strong>interns</strong> and are prepared for a short runway. Slots are limited and host participation is restricted.</li>
      <li><span class="pill">Mid-Career Pathways</span> Useful for a <strong>trial attachment</strong> for candidates aged <strong>40 and above</strong>, with an allowance cap of <strong>$3,800 per month</strong>.</li>
      <li><span class="pill">CCP</span> Often the best option when you want a <strong>real job</strong> with structured reskilling, and you want the <strong>strongest salary support</strong> across both under 40 and 40+ hires.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="grit">1) GRIT: internship style support, but limited access</h2>
    <p>
      GRIT is best understood as an internship style programme. From an employer perspective, it can be helpful if you are building a pipeline of junior talent
      and want to assess potential before making longer-term commitments.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Where GRIT fits well</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have capacity to supervise interns and provide meaningful exposure.</li>
      <li>You are hiring for entry level roles and want a structured “try-out” period.</li>
      <li>You are building a bench for future conversion to full-time roles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Typical constraints SMEs run into</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interns only:</strong> This does not solve immediate hiring for experienced roles.</li>
      <li><strong>Very limited slots:</strong> Availability is restricted and may not match your hiring timeline.</li>
      <li><strong>Host participation is restricted:</strong> Many companies cannot apply to become participating host companies, which makes it difficult to scale.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mcpp">2) Mid-Career Pathways Programme: designed for 40+, with a lower cap</h2>
    <p>
      The Mid-Career Pathways Programme is structured around mature candidates aged 40 and above.
      For employers, the attraction is a lower-risk engagement model while you assess suitability.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Where Mid-Career Pathways fits well</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are open to hiring mature candidates but want a “trial” structure before conversion.</li>
      <li>The role can be scoped within the allowance cap and still remain attractive to the candidate.</li>
      <li>You have a clear plan to convert the candidate into a substantive role if performance is strong.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Limitations to plan for</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Only those above 40:</strong> This excludes younger mid-career switchers, even if they are suitable.</li>
      <li><strong>Allowance capped at $3,800 per month:</strong> This can be restrictive for higher skilled or specialised roles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ccp">3) Career Conversion Programmes: why CCP is often the best fit for SMEs</h2>
    <p>
      Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) are structured reskilling pathways.
      In practice, CCP is often the most practical option for SMEs because it supports both hiring and conversion outcomes,
      with higher funding limits and broader applicability.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Why HR teams like CCP</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wider candidate pool:</strong> You can hire both under 40 and 40+ candidates.</li>
      <li><strong>Structured conversion:</strong> The programme expects clear job scope and skills conversion, which improves role clarity and onboarding success.</li>
      <li><strong>Better retention mechanics:</strong> When OJT is properly planned, productivity ramps faster and expectations are clearer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why Finance teams like CCP</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stronger salary support:</strong> Higher co-funding can materially reduce payroll burden during the conversion period.</li>
      <li><strong>Higher caps:</strong> Better fit for PMET roles and specialised positions.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable planning:</strong> CCP can be repeated across multiple roles if role scopes are designed properly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Funding support overview (commonly referenced figures)</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Below 40:</strong> up to <strong>70%</strong> salary support, capped at <strong>$5,000 per month</strong></li>
      <li><strong>40 and above:</strong> up to <strong>90%</strong> salary support, capped at <strong>$7,500 per month</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="decision">A simple decision guide for HR and Finance</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Are you looking for interns only?</strong><br />
        If yes, GRIT may be relevant, assuming you have access to host participation and the slots align with your timeline.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-top:0.8em;">
        <strong>Are you only considering candidates aged 40+ and want a short attachment structure?</strong><br />
        If yes, Mid-Career Pathways can be a sensible entry point, but check if the $3,800 cap fits your role level.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-top:0.8em;">
        <strong>Do you want the most flexible scheme that supports both under 40 and 40+ hires?</strong><br />
        If yes, CCP is usually the strongest option, particularly if you are hiring for roles with skills gaps and you can design a proper conversion pathway.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What makes a CCP application “strong” in practice</h2>
    <p>
      Funding is only one part of the story. A CCP tends to move faster and stand up better under review when the role conversion is clear.
      This usually means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Substantial job scope change:</strong> The new role must be meaningfully different from the candidate’s prior work, not a title change.</li>
      <li><strong>Role specific OJT plan:</strong> Milestones, supervision, tools and tasks should be clearly mapped.</li>
      <li><strong>Business justification:</strong> Show how the conversion addresses a capability gap or supports growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean documentation:</strong> JD, contract and training plan must align, with no contradictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is where BizGrants Consulting typically adds the most value for SMEs. We provide success-guaranteed, end-to-end application management and advisory support,
      covering role scoping, job redesign, structured OJT planning, document preparation, submission, and clarification management, so your application remains consistent,
      defensible, and aligned to programme expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you prefer a lower-effort route, we can run a quick role fit assessment and give you a clear view of whether the conversion case is strong before you commit time
      to the full application build.

      <h2>Common questions from employers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> We are an SME. Is CCP still realistic for us?<br />
          <strong>A:</strong> Yes, provided the role scope and OJT plan are designed properly. In fact, SMEs often benefit most because salary support reduces the risk of hiring for new capability areas.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top:0.9em;">
          <strong>Q:</strong> We want to hire someone under 40. Does CCP still make sense?<br />
          <strong>A:</strong> It can. CCP covers both under 40 and 40+ hires. The main question is whether the role requires genuine skills conversion and whether you have the supervisory capacity to deliver the OJT.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top:0.9em;">
          <strong>Q:</strong> What usually causes delays or rework?<br />
          <strong>A:</strong> Generic job scopes, weak evidence of conversion from prior experience, and OJT plans that read like internal onboarding rather than structured reskilling.
        </li>
      </ul>
