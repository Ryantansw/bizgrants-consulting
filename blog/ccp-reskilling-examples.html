    <h1>What Counts as “Reskilling” Under CCP? (Real-World Examples & Success Stories)</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>What Does “Reskilling” Mean in CCP?</h2>
    <p>
      Under Workforce Singapore’s CCP, “reskilling” is not just about training; it requires a significant change in job content. The new or redesigned role must differ by at least 50% from the employee’s previous job, and be supported by structured On-the-Job Training (OJT) and, where required, external courses.
    </p>
    <h2>Practical Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Admin Executive to Digital Marketing Associate:</strong> Employee is trained in Meta Ads, Google Analytics, and content creation, taking on new campaign responsibilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Procurement Specialist to Sustainability Officer:</strong> Staff is reskilled to handle ESG reporting, supplier audits, and implementation of green procurement standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Operations Supervisor to Data Analyst:</strong> Role redesign includes SQL training, dashboard reporting, and business intelligence tasks, with structured mentorship.</li>
      <li><strong>Retail Sales to Customer Success Specialist:</strong> Employee transitions from front-line sales to managing key client accounts, CRM systems, and support workflows.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Success Story: A Singapore SME’s Journey</h2>
    <p>
      One of our SME clients faced talent shortages in digital roles. By reskilling two admin staff to digital marketing and customer experience roles, and documenting clear OJT plans, they secured CCP support. Both staff are now critical to the company’s growth—and were promoted within 9 months.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips for a Successful Application</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrate at least 50% change in job tasks and responsibilities</li>
      <li>Provide a clear OJT plan aligned to SkillsFuture Singapore’s Skills Framework</li>
      <li>Showcase commitment to structured learning and career progression</li>
    </ul>
