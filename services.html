    <h1>Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs)</h1>
    <p>Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) are government-supported initiatives by Workforce Singapore to help companies reskill mid-career new hires or existing employees into new growth job roles. CCPs provide substantial funding support – for example, up to 90% salary subsidy during training – across roughly 30 industry sectors. These programmes follow structured pathways, often involving industry-recognized training and on-the-job learning, to equip workers with in-demand skills.</p>
    <h2>CCP Modes</h2>
    <p>There are three main modes of CCPs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Place-and-Train:</strong> Companies hire mid-career employees and provide on-the-job training or courses in new job roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Attach-and-Train:</strong> Companies host potential hires for attachments or training before formal placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Redesign Reskilling:</strong> Existing employees are sent for reskilling to take on redesigned or new roles aligned with industry needs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Our Services</h2>
