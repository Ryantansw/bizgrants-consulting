    <h2>What Are Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs)?</h2>
    <p>Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) are Workforce Singapore (WSG) initiatives designed to help employers reskill or redeploy mid-career individuals into new or redesigned job roles. Whether you're hiring new staff or transforming internal roles to meet evolving business needs, CCPs offer a practical and cost-effective workforce strategy.</p>
    <p>Companies receive up to <strong>70% to 90% salary support</strong> over 3 to 12 months, depending on the programme pathway and employee eligibility. CCPs are suitable for roles in sustainability, digital marketing, HR, international business development, and more. BizGrants Consulting helps ensure your roles are structured to meet funding criteria and manages the full application process.</p>
    <p>Each CCP includes job redesign, on-the-job training plans, and alignment to national skills frameworks. Our service includes advisory on eligibility, crafting eligible job scopes, developing SkillsFuture-compliant OJT, and submission handling — end to end.</p>
